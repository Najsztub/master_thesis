# Master's Thesis
## Retrieval of Kinetic Parameters of Titin Kinase Unfolding from Molecular Dynamics Simulations

I wrote my master's thesis at the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań as a last year student of Chemistry. I wrote it at the Department of Physical Chemistry, in a lab run by Prof. Andrzej Molski in 2011.

The thesis itself describes the process of simulating protein unfolding under external force to retrieve it's kinetic parameters. It involves Molecular Dynamics simulation software, GROMACS. It also provides a simple analysis of computational cluster efficiency.

Looking backward I really enjoyed my time spent at the Lab. Fortunately I had a lot of freedom to explore and learn. And I must admit that I learned a lot. Not only about specialistic simulation software, but especially about programming in Python. This is how my adventure with this language started. 

Looking back through my first scripts I must say, that they are not as terrible as I would expect them to be. Of course there's still a lot of ad hoc solutions in them, without any proper structure. But still, they worked. 

Also I learned a lot about Linux administration and networking, when building a simple computational cluster out of machines available at that time. Also I learned a lot about LaTeX and writing presentations in Beamer. 

All in all this is how my interest in programming had started. Without this experience I would not be where I am today. The whole team led by Prof. Molski helped me to put foundations for the work I am most proud of today.
